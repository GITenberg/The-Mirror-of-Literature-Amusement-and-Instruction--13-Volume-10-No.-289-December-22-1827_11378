<p>
Among the Suburban Beauties of The Metropolis, and As an Attraction For
Home-tourists, Bushy is Entitled to Special Notice, Independent of Its
Celebrity As the Retreat of Royalty&mdash;it Being The Residence Of <i>his
Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence</i>, an Accurate Portrait Of Whom Will
Be Presented, to Our Readers With the Usual <i>supplementary Number</i> At
The Close of the Present Volume Of The Mirror.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Bushy Park</i> is an appendage to the palace and honour of Hampton Court;
    and though far from assimilating to that splendid pile, it is better
    fitted for rural enjoyment, whilst its contiguity to the metropolis
    almost gives it the character of <i>rus in urbe</i>.<a id="footnotetag1"
    name="footnotetag1"></a> <a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> The residence is a
    handsome structure, and its arrangement is altogether well calculated
    for the indulgence of royal hospitality&mdash;a characteristic of its present
    distinguished occupant, as well as of that glorious profession, to the
    summit of which his royal highness has recently been exalted. The park,
    too, is well stocked with deer, and its rangership is confided to the
    duke. The pleasure grounds are tastefully disposed, and their beauty
    improved by the judicious introduction of temples and other artificial
    embellishments, among which, a naval temple, containing a piece of the
    mast of the Victory, before which Nelson fell, and a bust of the noble
    admiral, has been consecrated to his memory by the royal duke, with
    devotional affection, and the best feelings of a warm heart.
</p>
<p>
    The park is a thoroughfare, and the circumstances by which this public
    claim was established are worthy of record, as a specimen of the justice
    with which the rights of the community are upheld in this country. The
    <i>village Hampden</i>, in the present case, was one Timothy Bennet, of whom
    there is a fine print, which the neighbours, who are fond of a walk in
    Bushy Park, must regard with veneration. It has under it this
    inscription:&mdash;"Timothy Bennet; of Hampton Wick, in Middlesex, shoemaker,
    aged 75, 1752. This true Briton, (unwilling to leave the world worse
    than he found it,) by a vigorous application of the laws of his country
    in the cause of liberty, obtained a free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[pg
426]</span>
    passage through Bushy Park,
    which had many years been withheld from the public." Regeneration (or
    the renewal of souls) is, however, a shoemaker's <i>forte</i>.
</p>
<p>
    The above engraving of Bushy is copied from an elegant coloured view,
    drawn by Ziegler, and published by Griffiths, of Wellington-street,
    Strand.

    THE FUGITIVE.

<h3>
    A SCOTCH TALE.
</h3>
<h4>
    <i>(For the Mirror.)</i>
</h4>
<p>
    It was now abute the gloaming when my ain same Janet (heav'n sain her
    saul) was sitting sae bieldy in a bit neuk ayant the ingle, while the
    winsome weans gathering around their minnie were listing till some auld
    spae wife's tale o' ghaists and worriecows; when on a sudden some ane
    tirled at the door pin.
</p>
<p>
    "Here's your daddie, bairns," said the gudewife ganging till the door;
    but i' place o' their daddie, a tall chiel wrappit i' a big cloak,
    rushed like a fire flaught into the bield, and drappit doun on the
    sunkie ewest the ingle droghling and coghling.
</p>
<p>
    "What's your wull, friend?" said Janet, glowering on him a' i' a gliff,
    "the gudeman's awa."
</p>
<p>
    "Save me, save me," shrieghed the stranger, "the sleuth hounds are at my
    heels."
</p>
<p>
    "But wha may ye be, maister," cried the dame, "I durstna dee your
    bidding while Jamie's frae the hause."
</p>
<p>
    "Oh, dinna speir, dinna speir mistress," exclaimed the chiel a' in a
    curfuffle, "ainly for the loe of heav'n, hide me frae the red coats
    whilk are comin' belive&mdash;O God, they are here," he cried, as I entered
    the shealing, and uttering a piercing skirl, he sprung till the wa', and
    thrawing aff his cloak, drew his broad claymore, whilk glittered
    fearsome by the low o' the ingle.
</p>
<p>
    "Hauld, hauld, 'tis the gudeman his nainsell," shreighed Janet, when the
    stranger drapping the point o' the sword, clingit till my hand, and
    while the scauding tear draps tricklit adoun his face prigged me to fend
    him.
</p>
<p>
    "Tak' your certie o' that my braw callant," said I, "ne'er sail it be
    tauld o' Jamie Mc-Dougall, that he steeked his door again the puir and
    hauseless, an the bluidy sleuth hounds be on ye they'se find it ill
    aneugh I trow to get an inkling o' ye frae me, I'se sune shaw 'em the
    cauld shouther."
</p>
<p>
    Sae saying, I gared him climb a rape by whilk he gat abune the riggin o'
    the bield, then steeking to the door thro' whilk he gaed, I jimp had
    trailed doun the rape, when in rinned twa red coat chiels, who couping
    ilka ane i' their gait begun to touzle out the ben, and the de'il gaed
    o'er Jock Wabster.
</p>
<p>
    "Eh, sirs! eh, sirs!" cried I, "whatna gaits' that to steer a bodie, wad
    ye harry a puir chiel o' a' his warldly gear, shame till ye, shame till
    ye, shank yoursell's awa."
</p>
<p>
    "Fusht, fusht, fallow," cried ane o' the churls, "nane o' your bourds
    wi' us, or ye may like to be the waur aff; where is the faus loon? we
    saw him gae doun the loaning afore the shealing, and here he maun needs
    be."
</p>
<p>
    "Aweel, sirs," I exclaimed, "ye see there isna ony creatur here, our
    nainsell's out-taken; seek again an ye winna creed a bodie; may be the
    bogle is jumpit into the pot on the rundle-tree ower the ingle, or
    creepit into the meal ark or aiblins it scoupit thro' the hole as ye cam
    in at the door. Ye may threep and threep and wampish your arms abute, as
    muckle as ye wuss, ye silly gowks, I canna tell ye mair an I wad."
</p>
<p>
    "May be the Highland tyke is right, cummer, (said one o' the red coats)
    and the fallow is jumpit thro' the bole, but harkye maister gudeman, an
    ye hae ony mair o' your barns-breaking wi us, ye'se get a sark fu' o'
    sair banes, that's a'."
</p>
<p>
    "Hear till him, hear till him, Janet," said I, as the twa southron
    chiels gaed thro' the hole, trailing their bagganets alang wi' 'em;
    "winna the puir tykes hae an unco saft couch o' it, think ye, luckie, O
    'tis a gude sight for sair e'en to see 'em foundering and powtering i'
    the latch o' the bit bog aneath."
</p>
<p>
    "Nane o' your clashes e'enow, gudemon," said she, "but let the callant
    abune gang his gate while he may."
</p>
<p>
    "Ye're aye cute, dame," I cried, thrawing the bit gy abune, and in a
    gliffing, doun jumpit the chiel, and a braw chiel he was sure enough,
    siccan my auld e'en sall ne'er see again, wi' his brent brow and buirdly
    bowk wrappit in a tartan plaid, wi' a Highland kilt.
</p>
<p>
    "May the gude God o' heaven sain you," he said "and ferd you for aye,
    for the braw deed ye hae dreed the day; tak' this wee ring, gudemon, and
    tak' ye this ane, gudewife, and when ye look on this and on that, I rede
    ye render up are prayer to him abune for the weal o' Charles Edward,
    your unfortunate prince."
</p>
<p>
    Sae speaking, he sped rath frae the bield, and was sune lost i' the
    glunch shadows o' the mirk night.
</p>
<p>
    Mony and mony a day has since rollit ower me, and I am now but a dour
    carle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg
427]</span>
    whose auld pow the roll o' time hath blanched; my bonnie Janet is
    gone to her last hame, lang syne, my bairns hae a' fa'en kemping for
    their king and country, and I ainly am left like a withered auld trunk,
    waiting heaven's gude time when I sall be laid i' the mouls wi' my
    forbears.

    MERRY CHRISTMAS!

</blockquote>
<p>
    Since, my dear readers, even in this season of busy festivity I can
    spare a few moments to write for your gratification, I venture to hope
    you will spare a few to read for mine.
</p>
<p>
    And so here we are, once again on tiptoe for a merry Christmas and a
    happy new year. My good friends, especially my fair friends, permit me
    to wish you both. Yes, Christmas is here&mdash;Christmas, when winter and
    jollity, foul weather and fun, cold winds and hot pudding, good frosts
    and good fires, are at their meridian! Christmas! With what dear
    associations is it fraught! I remember the time when I thought that word
    cabalistical; when, in the gay moments of youth, it seemed to me a
    mysterious term for every thing that is delightful; and such is the
    force of early associations, that even now I cannot divest myself of
    them. Christmas has long ceased to be to me what it once was; yet do I
    even now hail its return with pleasure, with enthusiasm. But, alas! how
    differently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page428" id="page428"></a>[pg
428]</span> is it viewed, not only by the same individual at different
    periods of life, but by different individuals of the same age; by the
    rich and poor, the wretched and the happy, the pampered and the
    penniless!
</p>
<p>
    To proceed to the object of this paper, which is simply to throw
    together a few casual hints, connected with the period. I would beg my
    reader's attention, in the first place, to an odd superstition,
    countenanced by Shakspeare, and which, if he happens to lie awake some
    night, (say with the tooth-ache&mdash;what better?&mdash;for that purpose I mean,)
    he will have an opportunity of verifying. The passage which contains it
    is in <i>Hamlet</i> and exhibits at once his usual wildness of imagination,
    and a highly praiseworthy religious veneration for the season. Where the
    ghost vanishes upon the crowing of the cock, he takes occasion to
    mention its crowing all hours of the night about Christmas time. The
    last four lines comprise several other superstitions connected with the
    period:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p> It faded on the crowing of the cock.</p>
<p> Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes,</p>
<p> Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,</p>
<p> The bird of dawning singeth all night long.</p>
<p> And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad:</p>
<p> The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike;</p>
<p> No fairy takes; no witch hath power to charm;</p>
<p> So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
    It is to be lamented that the hearty diet, properly belonging to the
    season, should have become almost peculiar to it; the <i>Tatler</i>
    recommends it throughout the year. "I shall begin," says Steele, "with a
    very earnest and serious exhortation to all my well-disposed readers,
    that they would return to the food of their forefathers, and reconcile
    themselves to beef and mutton. This was the diet which bred that hardy
    race of mortals who won the fields of Cressy and Agincourt. I need not
    go so high up as the history of Guy, earl of Warwick, who is well known
    to have eaten up a dun cow of his own killing. The renowned king Arthur
    is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a whole
    roasted ox, which was certainly the best way to preserve the gravy; and
    it is farther added, that he and his knights sat about it at his round
    table, and usually consumed it to the very bones before they would enter
    upon any debate of moment. The Black Prince was a professed lover of the
    brisket; not to mention the history of the sirloin, or the institution
    of the order of Beefeaters, which are all so many evident and undeniable
    proofs of the great respect which our warlike predecessors have paid to
    this excellent food. The tables of the ancient entry of this nation were
    covered thrice a day with hot roast-beef; and I am credibly informed by
    an antiquary, who has searched the registers in which the bills of fare
    of the court are recorded, that instead of tea and bread and butter
    which have prevailed of late years, the maids of honour in queen
    Elizabeth's time were allowed three rumps of beef for their breakfast!"
</p>
<p>
    Now this is manly, and so is the diet it advises; I recommend both to my
    readers. Let each determine to make one convert, himself that one. On
    Christmas day, let each dine off, or at least have on his table, the
    good old English fare, roast beef and plum-pudding! and does such beef
    as our island produces need recommendation? What more nutritive and
    delicious? and, for a genuine healthy Englishman, what more proper than
    this good old national English dish? Let him whose stomach will not bear
    it, look about and insure his life&mdash;I would not give much for it. It
    ought, above all other places, to be duly honoured in our officers'
    mess-rooms. As Prior says,
</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"If I take Dan Congreve right,</p>
<p>Pudding and beef make Britons fight."</p>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
    So, then, if beef be indeed so excellent,
    we shall not much wonder that Shakspeare
    should say,
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
    &mdash;"A pound of man's flesh
    Is not so estimable or profitable.
    As flesh of mutton, beeves, or goats!"
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The French have christened us (and I think it no disreputable
    <i>sobriquet</i>) Jack Roastbeef, from a notion we cannot live without
    roast-beef, any more than without plum-pudding, porter, and punch;
    however, the notion is palpably erroneous. We are proving more and more
    every day&mdash;to our shame be it spoken!&mdash;that we can live without it. At
    least do not let it be said we can pass a Christmas without it, merely
    to make way for turkeys, fricassees, and ragouts! "Oh, reform it
    altogether!"

    England was always famous among foreigners for the celebration of
    Christmas, at which time our ancestors introduced many sports and
    pastimes unknown in other countries, or now even among ourselves. "At
    the feast of Christmas," says Stowe, "in the king's court, wherever he
    chanced to reside, there was appointed a lord of misrule, or master of
    merry disports; the same merry fellow made his appearance at the house
    of every nobleman and gentleman of distinction; and, among the rest, the
    lord mayor of London and the sheriffs had their lords of misrule, ever
    contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make the rarest
    pastime to delight the beholders." Alas! where are all these, or any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg
429]</span>
    similar, "merry disports" in our degenerate days? We have no "lords of
    misrule" now; or, if we have, they are of a much less innocent and
    pacific character. Mr. Cambridge, also, (No 104, of the <i>World</i>) draws a
    glowing picture of an ancient Christmas. "Our ancestors," says he,
    "considered Christmas in the double light of a holy commemoration and a
    cheerful festival; and accordingly distinguished it by devotion, by
    vacation from business, by merriment and hospitality. They seemed
    eagerly bent to make themselves and every body about them happy. With
    what punctual zeal did they wish one another a merry Christmas! and what
    an omission would it have been thought, to have concluded a letter
    without the compliments of the season! The great hall resounded with the
    tumultuous joys of servants and tenants, and the gambols they played
    served as an amusement to the lord of the mansion and his family, who,
    by encouraging every art that conduced to mirth and entertainment,
    endeavoured to soften the rigour of the season, and to mitigate the
    influence of winter. How greatly ought we to regret the neglect of
    mince-pies, which, besides the idea of merry-making inseparable from
    them, were always considered as the test of schismatics! How zealously
    were they swallowed by the orthodox, to the utter confusion of all
    fanatical recusants! If any country gentleman should be so unfortunate
    in this age as to lie under a suspicion of heresy, where will he find so
    easy a method of acquitting himself as by the ordeal of plum-porridge?"
    This alludes to the Puritans, who refused to observe Christmas, or any
    other festival of the church, either by devotion or merriment. And I
    regret to say there are certain modern "fanatical recusants," certain
    modern Puritans, as schismatical in this particular as their gloomy
    precursors. Mr. Cambridge then proceeds "to account for a revolution
    which has rendered this season (so eminently distinguished in former
    times) now so little different from the rest of the year," which he
    thinks "no difficult task." The reasons he assigns are, the decline of
    devotion, and the increase of luxury, the latter of which has extended
    rejoicings and feastings, formerly peculiar to Christmas, through the
    whole year; these have consequently lost their raciness, the appetite
    for amusement has become palled by satiety, and the relish for it,
    reserved formerly for this particular season, is now no longer peculiar
    to it, having been already dissipated and exhausted. Another cause he
    assigns is, "the too general desertion of the country, the great scene
    of hospitality." Now this was written just fifty-three years ago, and as
    all the causes assigned for the declension of this grand national
    festivity up to that period are incontrovertible, and have been
    operating even more powerfully ever since, they will sufficiently
    account for the still greater declension observable in our days. And the
    declension appears to me to consist in this,&mdash;there is more gastronomy
    and expanse, but less heartiness and hospitality; and these latter are
    the only legitimate characteristics of Englishmen. Be they then
    restored, this very Christmas, to the English character; the opportunity
    is fast approaching&mdash;be it employed.
</p>

    I know nothing better to conclude with than a good old Christmas carol
    from <i>Poor Robin's Almanack</i> for 1695, preserved in Brand's <i>Popular
    Antiquities</i>, to which work I refer those of my readers who may require
    further information on the subject of Christmas customs and

<h3>
    THE TURKS.
</h3>
<h4>
    <i>(For the Mirror.)</i>
</h4>
<p>
    The Turks have a manly and prepossessing demeanour; being generally of a
    good stature, and remarkably well formed in their limbs. The men shave
    their heads, but wear long beards, and are extremely proud of their
    mustaches, which are usually turned downwards, and which give the other
    features of the face a cast of peculiar pensiveness. They wear turbans,
    sometimes white, of an enormous size on their heads, and never remove
    them but when they go to repose. Their breeches, or drawers, are united
    with their stockings, and they have slippers, which they never put off
    but when they enter a mosque, or the house of a great man. Large shirts
    are worn, and over them is a vest tied with a sash; the outer garment
    being a sort of loose gown. Every man, in whatever station he is,
    carries a dagger in his sash. The women's attire much resembles that of
    the other sex, only they have a cap on their heads, something like a
    bishop's mitre, instead of a turban. Their hair is beautiful and long,
    mostly black, but their faces, which are remarkably handsome, are so
    covered when they walk out, that nothing is to be seen but their eyes.
    The ladies of the sultan's <i>haram</i> are lovely virgins, either captives
    taken during war, or presents from the governors of provinces. They are
    never allowed to stir abroad except when the grand signior removes; and
    then they are put into close chariots, signals being made at certain
    distances that no man may approach the road through which the ladies
    pass, on pain of death. There are a great number of female <i>slaves</i> in
    the sultan's haram, whose task it is to wait on the ladies, who have,
    besides, a black eunuch for their superintendant.
</p>
<p>
    There are three colleges in Turkey where the children of distinguished
    men are educated and fitted for state employments. The children are
    first approved by the grand signior before they are allowed to enter
    these seminaries; and none dare come into his majesty's presence who are
    not handsome and well-made. Silence is first taught them, and a becoming
    behaviour to their superiors; then they are instructed in the Mahometan
    faith, the Turkish and Persian languages, and afterwards in the Arabic.
    At the age of twenty-one they are taught all manner of manly exercises,
    and above all, the use of arms. As they advance to proficiency in these,
    and other useful arts, and as government places become vacant, they are
    preferred; but it is to be observed, that they generally attain the age
    of forty before they are thought capable of being entrusted with
    important slate affairs.
</p>
<p>
    Those who hold any office under the grand signior are called his slaves;
    the term slave, in Turkey, signifying the most honourable title a
    subject can bear. The grand signior is commonly supposed among his own
    people, to be something more than human; for he is not bound by any laws
    except that of professing and maintaining the Mahometan religion. A
    stranger desiring to be admitted into his majesty's presence, is first
    examined by proper persons, and his arms taken from him; he is then
    ushered before the royal personage between two strong supporters, but is
    not even then permitted to approach near enough to kiss the sultan's
    foot. <a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a> <a href=
    "#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    This custom, which is observed by every sultan, originated in
    the following manner:&mdash;Amurath I. having obtained a great victory over
    the Christians, was on the field of battle with his officers viewing the
    dead, when a wounded Christian soldier, rising from among the slain,
    came staggering towards him. The king, supposing the man intended to beg
    for his life, ordered the guards to make way for him; but drawing near,
    he drew a dagger from under, his coat, and plunged it into the heart of
    the great king, who instantly died.
</p>
<p>
    In Turkey, no man marries a deformed wife for the sake of a fortune, as
    with us; beauty and good sense, to their credit be it spoken, are the
    only inducements to matrimony among the Turks. But they are an indolent
    people, and are much averse to improving their country by commerce,
    planting, or building; appearing to take delight in letting their
    property run to ruin. Alexandria, Tyre, and Sidon, which once commanded
    the navigation and trade of the whole world, are at present in the
    Turks' possession, but are only very inconsiderable places. Indeed,
    observes a judicious author, it is well for us that the Turks are such
    an indolent people, for their situation and vast extent of empire, would
    enable them to monopolize the trade of the world if they attended to it.
    They appear to possess very little genius or inclination for the
    improvement of <i>arts and sciences</i> although they live in countries which
    were once in the possession of the classic Greeks; but seem to prefer a
    slothful mode of life to an active one, continually
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page431" id="page431"></a>[pg
431]</span>
    sauntering away their
    time, either among women, or in taking coffee and smoking. Being men of
    great taciturnity, they very seldom disturb a stranger with questions; and
    a person may live in their country a dozen years, without having twenty
    words addressed to him, except on important business. They seldom
    travel, and have very little wish to be informed of the state of their
    own, or any other country; when a minister of state is turned out of his
    place, or strangled, (which is a frequent custom,) they coldly observe
    that there will be a new one, without inquiring into the reason of the
    disgrace of the former. The doctrine of predestination prevails, and
    they therefore think it wicked to endeavour to avoid their fate;
    frequently entering houses where they know the plague is raging.
</p>
<p>
    All religions are tolerated in Turkey, though none are encouraged but
    the Mahometan faith. The Christians have churches, which the Turks not
    unfrequently convert into mosques for their own use; nor will they
    suffer any new churches, or temples, to be built, without extorting an
    exorbitant fine from the poor Christians. The high-priest of the
    Mahometan religion is called the <i>mufti</i>; he is invested with great
    power, and his seal is necessary to the passing of all acts of state.
    But any individual, who pleases to take the habit, may be a priest, and
    may leave the office when he is weary of it; for there is nothing like
    ordination among them.

<h3>
    PULQUE.
</h3>
<p>
    Pulque, which is the favourite drink of the Mexicans, is extracted from
    the Manguey, or Great American Aloe; at the time of throwing its flower
    stem, it is hollowed in the centre and the juice which should have
    supplied the flowers, is taken from it daily, for about two months;
    which juice when fermented is immediately fit for drinking. A very
    strong brandy is obtained by distillation. So great is the consumption
    that the duty collected at the city gates, amounts annually to 600,000
    dollars&mdash;<i>From a Correspondent</i>.
</p>
<h3>
    HATCHING CHICKENS.
</h3>
<p>
    The following singular, though effectual mode of hatching chickens,
    prevails in the interior of Sumatra; and is vouched for by Major Clayton
    of the Bencoolen council:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    The hens, whether from being frightened off their nests by the rats,
    which are very numerous and destructive, or from some other cause
    hitherto prevalent in Sumatra, do not hatch their chickens in the
    ordinary way, as is seen in almost all other climates. The natives have
    for this purpose, in each village, several square rooms, the walls of
    which are made of a kind of brick, dried in the sun. In the middle of
    these rooms they make a large fire, round which they place their eggs at
    regular distances. In this manner they let them lie for fourteen days,
    now and then turning them, that the warmth may be equal in all parts;
    and on the fifteenth day, the chicken makes its appearance, and proves
    in every respect as strong as those hatched according to the course of
    nature.&mdash;<i>From a Correspondent.</i>
</p>
<h3>
    AFRICAN COOKERY.
</h3>
<p>
    The legs and feet of the rhinoceros are cooked in the following curious
    method by the wild tribes of Southern Africa:&mdash;The ants nests are
    composed of hard clay, shaped like a baker's oven, and are from two to
    four feet in height. Some of these are excavated by the people, and
    their innumerable population destroyed. The space thus obtained is
    filled with lighted fuel, till the bottom and sides become red hot
    within. The embers of the wood are then removed, the leg or foot of the
    rhinoceros introduced, and the door closed up with heated clay and
    embers. Fire is also made on the outside over the nests, and the flesh
    is allowed to remain in it several hours. Food cooked in this way is
    highly relished by all the tribes.
</p>
<h3>
    EASTERN DIVORCES.
</h3>
<p>
    If a man pronounce three divorces against a free woman, or two against a
    slave, he can lawfully wed neither of them again, unless they have been
    espoused by another, and this second husband dies, or shall divorce
    them. When it happens that a husband wishes to recover his wife, whom he
    had divorced in a passion, a convenient husband is sought; but the law
    forbids a mockery being made of such marriages. They may be short in
    duration, but the parties must live, during the period they are united,
    as man and wife.
</p>
<h3>
    ARAB CHARACTER.
</h3>
<p>
    The Arabs have always been commended by the ancients for the fidelity of
    their attachments, and they are still scrupulously exact to their words,
    and respectful to their kindred; they have been universally celebrated
    for their quickness of apprehension and penetration, and the vivacity of
    their wit. Their language is certainly one of the most ancient in the
    world; but it has many dialects. The Arabs, however, have their vices
    and defects. They are naturally addicted to war; and so vindictive as
    scarcely ever to forget an injury. Select Biography.

<h3>
    GENERAL FOY.
</h3>
<p>
    The military career of this hero was one of singular activity. Foy was
    born in 1775, and educated in the military school of La Fere, and made
    sub-lieutenant of artillery in 1792. He was present at the battles of
    Valmy and Jemappe, and in 1793 obtained a company&mdash;promotion was rapid
    in those days. In all the subsequent campaigns he was actively employed
    under Dumourier, Pichegru, Moreau, Massena, &amp;c. In 1803, he was colonel
    of the 5th regiment of horse artillery, and refused, from political
    principles, the appointment of aide-de-camp on Napoleon's assumption of
    the imperial throne; but was still employed, and shared in the victories
    of the short but brilliant campaign of Germany in 1804. In 1806 he
    commanded the artillery of the army stationed in Friuli, for the purpose
    of occupying the Venetian territory incorporated by the treaty of
    Presburg with the kingdom of Italy. In 1807 he was sent to
    Constantinople to introduce European tactics in the Turkish service&mdash;but
    this object was defeated by the death of Selim, and the opposition of
    the Janissaries. On Foy's return, the expedition against Portugal was
    preparing, and he received a command in the artillery under Junot,
    during the occupation of Portugal, and filled the post of inspector of
    forts and fortresses. He was severely wounded at the battle of Vimiera.
    On the capitulation he returned to France, and with the same army
    proceeded to Spain; and, subsequently, under the command of Soult, again
    went into Portugal. When commanded to summon the Bishop of Oporto to
    open its gates, he was seized and stript by the populace, and thrown
    into prison, and escaped with difficulty. The same year he was made
    general of brigade. In 1810, he made a skilful retreat at the head of
    600 men, in the face of 6,000 Spaniards, across the Sierra de Caceres;
    and at the head of his brigade was wounded in the battle of Busaco.
    Early in 1811 he was selected by Massena to convey to the emperor the
    critical state of the French army before the lines of Torres Vedras.
    This commission, though one of great peril&mdash;the country being in a
    complete state of insurrection&mdash;he successfully accomplished, and
    brought back the emperor's instructions, for which service he was made
    general of division. In July 1812, Foy was in the battle of Salamanca,
    and was one of those who, when Lord Wellington raised the siege of
    Burgos and retreated to the Douro, hung upon his rear, and took some
    prisoners and artillery.
</p>
<p>
    On the news of the disasters in Russia, and Lord Wellington's consequent
    resumption of offensive movements, Foy was sent with his division beyond
    Vittoria to keep the different parties in check; and after the battle of
    Vittoria, at which he was not present, he collected at Bergana 20,000
    troops, of different divisions, and had some success in skirmishes with
    the Spanish corps forming the left wing of the allied army. He arrived
    at Tolosa about the same time with Lord Lynedoch, and after a sanguinary
    contest in that town, retreated upon Irun&mdash;from which he was quickly
    dislodged, and finally recrossed the Bidassao. In the affair of the
    passage of the Nive, on the 9th of December, 1813, and the battle of St.
    Pierre d'Irrube on the 13th, Foy distinguished himself, and in the hard
    fought battle of Orthez, on the 27th of February, 1814, he was left
    apparently dead on the field. Before this period be had been made count
    of the empire, and commander of the legion of honour. In March 1815, he
    was appointed inspector general of the fourteenth military division; but
    on the return of Napoleon, during the 100 days, he embraced the cause of
    the emperor, and commanded a division of infantry in the battles of
    Ligny and Waterloo, at the last of which he received his fifteenth
    wound. This terminated his military career. In 1819, he was elected a
    member of the Chamber of Deputies, the duties of which he discharged
    till his death in November 1825; and from his first entrance into the
    chamber, was distinguished for his eloquence, and quickly became the
    acknowledged leader of the opposition&mdash;<i>From Foy's History of the

<i>Museum of Natural History.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    There is now exhibiting in one of the Saloons of "The Egyptian Hall," in
    Piccadilly, an interesting collection of zoological rarities, stated to
    have been assembled by M. Villet, at the Cape of Good Hope. Some of the
    specimens, especially the birds, are really beautiful; none but the
    smallest being cooped up in glazed cases; but many are effectively
    placed on branches of trees, whilst the quadrupeds are arranged with
    still better taste. Among the latter is a fine Hippopotamus, the
    Behemoth of Scripture. We are happy to hear this exhibition has already
    been numerously visited, since it augurs well of public taste and
    intellectual curiosity.

    <i>Conchology.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    Akin to the preceding exhibition in its claim to popular attention, may
    be noticed a pleasing collection of shells, now open to the public, a
    short distance from Somerset House. To the mere tyro in zoology, shells
    are attractive as the elegant sports of nature, in the beauty,
    splendour, and intricacy of their colours and structure; while their
    scientific arrangement is one of the most delightful pursuits of refined
    minds.

    <i>Grafting.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    The quince, used as a stock, has the property of stunting the growth of
    pears, of forcing them to produce bearing branches, instead of sterile
    ones, and of accelerating the maturity of the fruit.
</p>
<h3>
    <i>Sirocco Wind.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    The depressing effects of the corroding wind of a hot Sirocco can only
    be conceived by those who have suffered from them; the unwonted dulness
    with which it overcasts even the most active mind; the deep-drawn sighs
    it will elicit; and if there be one melancholy feeling which presses on
    the heart more heavily than another, it is the ample developement which
    it enjoys during the prevalence of this enervating breeze. It seldom,
    however, blows with force; it is rather an exhalation than a wind. It
    scarcely moves the leaves around the traveller, but it sinks heavily and
    damply in his heart. A stranger is at first unaware of the cause of the
    mental misery he endures; his temper sours as his spirits sink; every
    person, and every circumstance, annoys him; it affects even his dreams;
    sleep itself is not a refuge from querulous peevishness, and every
    motion is an irritating exertion.

    <i>Polar Expedition.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    The government of the United States has appointed an expedition, under

    to St. Diego, St. Pedro, in California.

    <i>Lithography.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    From an article which has appeared in a late number of the "Biblioteca
    Italiana," it appears that Sermefelder was not the original discoverer
    of the art of Lithography, but Simon Schmidt, a professor at the Cadet
    Hospital at Munich.

    <i>Small Pox.</i>
</h3>
<p>

<p>
    A valuable museum of the products of Chinese skill and industry has
    recently been exhibited at Rome, in which the progress made by a people
    of whom so little is known, and civilization and the arts, is
    demonstrated. The manufacture of bronzes, porcelain, gold work, and
    casts in copper, has arrived in China at an approach to perfection which
    the most advanced European nations would find it difficult to surpass.
    Some of the Chinese vases may really be compared to those of the finest
    time of Greece. The sculptures and the paintings, even with reference to
    anatomical precision, are as highly finished as ours.

    <i>Recovery from Suspended Animation</i>.
</h3>
<p>
    A case is reported in a recent number of the <i>Bulletin Universel</i>, by a
    French physician, M. Bourgeois, showing the importance of never
    abandoning all hope of success in restoring animation. A person who had
    been twenty minutes under water, was treated in the usual way for the
    space of half an hour without success: when a ligature being applied to
    the arm, above a vein that had been previously opened, ten ounces of
    blood were withdrawn, after which the circulation and respiration
    gradually returned, though accompanied by the most dreadful convulsions.
    A second, and a third bleeding was had recourse to, which brought about
    a favourable sleep, and ultimate recovery on the ensuing day.

    <i>Hair</i>.
</h3>
<p>
    At a recent meeting of the Academy of Sciences, at Paris, M. F. Cuvier,
    in a memoir on the generation of feathers, spines, and hair, introduced
    the following curious conclusion:&mdash;"I consider the organic system which
    produces hair as analogous to that of the senses, and even as forming
    part of them; for the hair is in a great number of animals a very
    sensitive organ of touch. It is not only in mustaches that we have a
    proof of it, but on the whole surface of the body. The slightest touch
    of a hair is sufficient in cats, for example, to make them contort their
    skin and shudder, as they do when they find something light attached to
    the hair, and that they wish to shake off."

    <i>Singing</i>.
</h3>
<p>
    The following passage from a letter by the late <i>Carl M. Von Weber</i>
    appears to be worthy of the attention of dramatic and other singers:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    "Every singer imparts, though unconsciously, the colouring of his own
    individual character to the dramatic character which he sustains. Thus,
    two singers, the one possessed of a slight and flexible voice, the other
    of an organ of great volume and power, will give the same composition in
    a manner widely different. The one will, doubtless, be more animated
    than the other; and yet both may do justice to the composer, inasmuch as
    both mark the gradations of passion in his composition, faithfully and
    expressively, according to the nature and degree of power possessed by
    each. But it is the duty of the music director to prevent the singer
    from deceiving himself, by following too exclusively what at first
    appears to him most suitable. This caution is particularly necessary
    with respect to certain passages, but the effect of the whole piece
    should not suffer for the sake of some favourite roulade, which the
    singer must needs introduce."
</p>
<h3>
    <i>Culture of Turnips.</i>
</h3>
<p>
    Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, this valuable root was
    cultivated among us only in gardens or other small spots, for culinary
    purposes; but Lord Townshend, attending King George the First on one of
    his excursions to Germany, in the quality of secretary of State,
    observed the turnip cultivated in open and extensive fields, as fodder
    for cattle, and spreading fertility over lands naturally barren; and on
    his return to England he brought over with him some of the seed, and
    strongly recommended the practice which he had witnessed to the adoption
    of his own tenants, who occupied a soil similar to that of Hanover. The
    experiment succeeded; the cultivation of field turnips gradually spread
    over the whole county of Norfolk; and in the course of time it has made
    its way into every other district of England. The reputation of the
    county as an agricultural district dates from the vast improvements of
    heaths, wastes, sheepwalks, and warrens, by enclosure and manuring&mdash;the
    fruit of the zealous exertions of Lord Townshend and a few neighbouring
    land-owners&mdash;which were, ere long, happily imitated by others. Since
    these improvements were effected, rents have risen in that county from
    one or two shillings to fifteen or twenty shillings per acre; a country
    of sheep-walks and rabbit-warrens has been rendered highly productive;
    and by dint of management, what was thus gained has been preserved and
    improved even to the present moment. Some of the finest corn-crops in
    the world are now grown upon lands which, before the introduction of the
    turnip husbandry, produced a very scanty supply of grass for a few lean
    and half-starved rabbits. Mr. Colquhoun, in his "Statistical
    Researches," estimated the value of the turnip crop annually grown in
    this country at fourteen millions; but when we further recollect that it
    enables the agriculturist to reclaim and cultivate land which, without
    its aid, would remain in a hopeless state of natural barrenness; that it
    leaves the land so clean and in such fine condition, as almost to insure
    a good crop of barley and a kind plant of clover, and that this clover
    is found a most excellent preparative for wheat, it will appear that the
    subsequent advantages derived from a crop of turnips must infinitely
    exceed its estimated value as fodder for cattle. If we were, therefore,
    asked to point out the individual who, in modern times, has proved the
    greatest benefactor to the community, we should not hesitate to fix upon
    the ingenious nobleman, whom the wits and courtiers of his own day were
    pleased to laugh at as "Turnip Townshend." In something less than one
    hundred years, the agricultural practice which he introduced from
    Hanover has spread itself throughout this country, and now yields an
    annual return which, probably, exceeds the interest of our national
    debt.&mdash;<i>Sir Walter Scott&mdash;in the Quarterly Review.</i>

<h3>
    POTIER, THE FRENCH "LISTON."
</h3>
<p>
    Potier, generally speaking&mdash;and it is the same with our own Liston&mdash;has
    never Actually observed any thing of what he presents to us. It is the
    spontaneous effusion of his own feelings&mdash;the immediate creation of his
    own mind&mdash;frequently arising at the moment at which we see it, and
    therefore never to be seen a second time&mdash;but always generated by the
    actor himself, and never mixed up with any thing else of an extraneous
    nature. This is one cause of the extraordinary variety of this actor,
    and consequently of his extraordinary popularity in his own country. We
    never tire of going to see him, because he is never the same on any two
    nights&mdash;or rather he never performs the same character twice in the same
    manner. It is also the secret of his unrivalled originality. There are
    but very few characters in which he can repeat himself, even if he
    would. And those are such as depend for their comicality upon collateral
    circumstances connected with them, rather than upon any thing essential
    to themselves.
</p>
<p>
    There are some persons whose every look, feature, expression, and tone
    of voice conduce to comic effects; and many an actor has owed his
    success more to these than to any mental qualities or dispositions
    corresponding with them; or has even been successful in spite of these
    latter being in no degree adapted to the profession which circumstances
    have induced him to adopt. In proof of this fact, comic actors are quite
    as often dull and solemn people, as droll ones, in private life. The
    most remarkable instance of a face being a fortune, in this respect, is
    our own Liston. If he had not possessed a comic countenance, nothing
    could have prevented him from being a tragic actor, or have made him a
    comic one; for it is well understood that all his inclinations led him
    in that direction. The truth is, that Liston's style of acting is too
    chaste and natural to have been so universally popular as it is, but for
    the irresistible drollery of his features&mdash;which are the finest farce
    that ever was written. Now in this respect, as in all others, Potier
    differs from his contemporaries.
</p>
<p>
    His voice, his face, and his person altogether, are in themselves
    antidotes to mirth, and might almost be supposed to set it at defiance.
    He might play the <i>Apothecary</i>, in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, or the <i>Anatomie
    Vivante</i>, without painting for them&mdash;as Stephen Kemble used to play
    their antithesis, <i>Falstaff</i>, without stuffing. And yet, instead of this
    seeming contradiction counteracting the essentially comic turn of his
    mind, the latter is so completely paramount, that it changes every thing
    within its reach to its own complexion.&mdash;<i>New Monthly Magazine.</i>

<h3>
    FRAGMENT OF THE NARRATIVE OF A STUDENT AT LAW.
</h3>
<p>
    This is a portion of what the writer calls "a series of the most
    singular and mysterious events," commenced January 29,1791. It is
    perhaps a romance of <i>real life</i>, although there is something in it
    beyond probability&mdash;but nothing impossible. Our <i>student</i> is at first
    almost <i>cut</i> by an acquaintance for neglecting to notice him in the
    park, when in fact he was not in the park: the hall butler of the Temple
    proves by the parchment that he dined there four days of term, when he
    was sick, and some distance from town: next he is <i>cut</i> by a second
    acquaintance for not recognising him at a masquerade: then a similar
    affair occurs with a beautiful girl in &mdash;&mdash;- square; at the Theatre; and
    on the Serpentine. He is next recognised by an old friend at a
    gaming-table, who mentions the sale of an estate there for his last
    stake, which property our student really had sold, though under
    different circumstances; and then rejected by his <i>chre amie</i> for a
    slight which he never offered. The last event or link of this mysterious
    chain is familiarly narrated as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    In returning one morning from Westminster, as I was passing through one
    of those small courts between Essex-street and Norfolk-street, (for of
    late I had sought the most retired ways,) I observed that two persons,
    of rather mean appearance, seemed to be dogging my footsteps. Uneasy at
    this circumstance, I hastened directly on to my chambers. I had,
    however, scarcely seated myself, when my servant informed me that two
    men wished to speak to me. On being admitted, they told me that they
    were officers of the police, and that they had a warrant to arrest me on
    a charge of felony. Surprise at the moment prevented my speaking; but as
    soon as I recovered myself I offered to accompany them to the
    magistrate. He was sitting, and the witnesses being in attendance, my
    examination took
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>[pg
436]</span>
    place immediately. A young man, of gentleman-like
    address, swore, that on the preceding evening he had been induced by one
    of his friends to visit one of the gambling-houses in the
    Haymarket&mdash;that he there saw me both playing and betting very
    rashly&mdash;that I appeared to be losing&mdash;that at length I quitted the room,
    and that soon afterwards his friend and himself followed. Now came the
    accusation. He swore, that just as he was leaving the door he felt some
    person drawing his purse from his pocket&mdash;that he immediately pursued
    the man, and at the corner of Jermyn-street seized <i>me.</i> That at first I
    submitted, and he dragged me to one of the lamps, and there most
    distinctly saw my countenance, when at that moment, by some piece of
    adroitness, which he could not explain, I slipped from his grasp, and
    instantly disappeared. His friend corroborated the story. The
    magistrate, after cautioning me, and expressing his regret at seeing a
    person of my appearance before him, asked me whether I wished to say any
    thing in my defence, I answered that I was the victim of some secret and
    devilish conspiracy, and that I would prove that I was at my chambers on
    the night in question. "I hope you may be able to do so," said the
    magistrate; "but in the mean time it is, my duty to commit you;" and I
    was conducted to gaol in a hackney-coach. I immediately summoned one or
    two of my friends, and after laying open to them the circumstances in
    which I had been placed, we concerted the best means of defence. My
    laundress could swear that I was in chambers the whole of the evening
    when the robbery was committed; and though this was the only direct
    evidence in my favour, yet I assembled at least a dozen persons, men of
    repute and station, as witnesses to my character. The trial excited
    prodigious interest, but what was that interest to the agony with which
    I regarded the issue! Should I be convicted, my mysterious enemies would
    enjoy, in triumph, my disgrace and degradation, and might probably
    proceed by the same diabolical contrivances to attempt even my life. The
    day came, and I was arraigned among a herd of common felons; but the
    consciousness of my innocence, and the hope of establishing it,
    supported my heart. No sooner had I heard the witnesses for the
    prosecution, than that hope died within me. A number of persons deposed,
    that on the night in question they had seen me in the gambling-house;
    but they were men of indifferent character, and not personally
    acquainted with me. At last, with astonishment and horror I saw my
    venerable friend, Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, put into the box, and heard him swear in
    positive terms that he was present in the room, and saw me at play. My
    defence availed nothing. The wretched old woman, whom I produced, as the
    court and jury believed, to establish my defence by perjury, was
    immediately discredited, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty. I
    was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. My feelings I will not
    attempt to describe.
</p>
<p>
    During my confinement I made the most energetic attempts to reconcile
    myself to my fatal destiny. I formed a plan for my future life, complete
    in every particular. My character being destroyed, and most of my
    friends alienated, I determined to convert my property into money, and
    to seek a refuge in the United States. At length the term of my
    imprisonment approached its close, and on the 30th of September, 1791, I
    was liberated&mdash;my flesh creeps as I name the day.
</p>
<p>
    I waited in the prison till it was dusk. Finding that I had the key of
    my chambers upon my person, I resolved, in the first instance, to visit
    once again the scene of my former tranquil studies. Before I reached the
    Temple the gates had been closed, and the gatekeeper, as I entered, eyed
    me with an unpleasant curiosity. I reached my chambers. There was still
    light sufficient to enable me to select some papers which I particularly
    wished to secure. I entered the chambers and walked in to my
    sitting-room, but suddenly stopped on seeing a figure reclining on the
    sofa. My library-table was before him, covered with law books. At first
    I imagined that my laundress had permitted some stranger to occupy my
    rooms during my incarceration. As I entered the chamber the figure rose,
    and with feelings of indescribable horror I perceived the semblance of
    myself&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;"And my flesh's hair upstood,
    'Twas mine own similitude."
</p>
<p>
    &mdash;I cannot relate what followed, for my senses deserted me. On
    recovering, my mysterious visiter had departed without leaving the
    slightest clue by which I might fathom the impenetrable secret of my
    persecutions. I have sometimes imagined that they arose from one of
    those wonderful natural resemblances which in some instances appear to
    be well authenticated; but, natural or supernatural, they changed the
    current of my life. Unable to endure the disgrace of being pointed at as
    a convicted felon, I converted my property into money, and, under
    another name, I now live respected in a foreign land.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>

    THE SELECTOR; AND LITERARY NOTICES OF NEW WORKS.

<hr />
<h3>
    "FASHIONABLE TALES."
</h3>
<p>
    Lord Normanby has written one of the best, if not <i>the best</i>, of this
    class of works, the tendency of which is in most instances of
    questionable character. But they give a tone to the reading taste of the
    day, as the recent circumstance of two of them forming the first subject
    of three <i>literary</i> reviews will sufficiently attest. The work to which
    we specially allude, is <i>Matilda, a Tale of the Day</i>, the noble author
    of which has just produced another of the same stamp, entitled <i>Yes and
    No</i>, to whose sketches and portraits we shall shortly introduce our
    readers. It will be seen that his lordship is no mean artist, nor does
    he belong to the novel-making tribe, whose hole-and-corner curiosity has
    made us as familiar with the <i>Corso</i> as we are with our own Bond-street.
    But the following snatch from <i>Yes and No</i> proves that these smatterers
    of fashion&mdash;these clippers of reputation&mdash;are encouraged by some portion
    of that class whose vanities they affect to expose:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    SCENE&mdash;<i>A "Hall" in the Country.</i>
</p>
<p>
    "It is always as well here to know who one's next neighbour is,"
    continued Fitzalbert, "for this is not one of those snug parties where
    one can do or say what one pleases without observation." "How do you
    mean?" asked Germain. "Why, Lady Boreton encourages these literary
    poachers on the manors, or rather <i>manners</i> of high life; she gives a
    sort of right of free chase to all cockney sportsmen to wing one's
    follies in a double-barrelled duodecimo, or hunt one's eccentricities
    through a hot-pressed octavo. Not that they are, generally speaking,
    very formidable shots&mdash;they often bring down a different bird from the
    one they aimed at, and sometimes shut their eyes and blaze away at the
    whole covey; which last is, after all, the best way. Their coming here
    to pick out individuals is needless trouble. Do you know the modern
    recipe for a finished picture of fashionable life? Let a gentleman<i>ly</i>
    man, with a gentleman<i>ly</i> style, take of foolscap paper a few quires;
    stuff them well with high-sounding titles&mdash;dukes and duchesses, lords
    and ladies, <i>ad libitum</i>. Then open the peerage at random, pick a
    supposititious author out of one page of it, and fix the imaginary
    characters upon some of the rest; mix it all up with quantum suff. of
    puff, and the book is in a second edition before ninety-nine readers out
    of a hundred have found out the one is as little likely to have written,
    as the others to have done what is attributed to them."
</p>
<p>
    Again&mdash;here is a picture of the guests: "Captains that have been to the
    North Pole; chemists who can extract ice from caloric; transatlantic
    travellers and sedentary bookworms; some authors, who own to anonymous
    publications they have never written; and others who are suspected of
    those they deny; besides the usual quantum of young ladies and
    gentlemen, who rest their claims to distinction upon the traditionary
    deeds of their great grandfathers."

    SOCIETY OF UNITED IRISHMEN.
</h3>
<p>
    At the head of the table, which occupied the centre of the apartment,
    and in an arm-chair raised by a few steps from the floor, sat the
    president of the society of United Irishmen. He alone was covered, and
    though plainly dressed, there was an air of high breeding and
    distinction about him; while in his bland smile were exhibited, the open
    physiognomy of pleasantness, and love-winning mildness, which still mark
    the descendants of the great Anglo-Norman Lords of the Pale, the Lords
    of Ormond, Orrery, and Arran, the Mount Garrets, and Kilkennys,&mdash;in
    former times, the great oligarchs of Ireland, and in times more recent,
    the grace and ornament of the British court.
</p>
<p>
    The president was the Honourable Simon Butler: beside him, on a lower
    seat, sat the secretary. His uncovered head, and unshaded temples
    received the full light of the suspended lamp. It was one of those
    finely chiselled heads, which arrest the imagination, and seem to bear
    incontrovertible evidence of the certainty of physiognomical science. A
    dress particularly studied, was singularly contrasted with the athletic
    figure and antique bearing of this interesting looking person. For
    though unpowdered locks, and the partial uncovering of a muscular neck,
    by the loose tie of the silk handkerchief had something of the
    simplicity of republicanism, yet the fine diamond chat sparkled at the
    shirt breast, and the glittering of two watch-chains (the foppery of the
    day), exhibited an aristocracy of toilet, which did not exactly assort
    with the Back-lane graces. The secretary of the United Irishmen, was
    Archibald Hamilton Rowan.
</p>
<p>
    On the opposite side sat a small, well-formed, and animated person, who
    was talking with singular vivacity of look and gesture, to one of
    extremely placid and even formal appearance. The first was the gay,
    gallant, and patriotic founder of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>[pg
438]</span>
    the society, Theobald Wolfe Tone, the
    other was the celebrated and clever Doctor Drennan, a skilful physician,
    and an elegant writer, who might have passed in appearance, for the
    demure minister of some remote village-congregation of the Scotch kirk.
</p>
<p>
    A tail, elegant, and sentimental looking person sat near to them, in an
    attitude of interested attention, listening to the speaker, to whom, it
    seemed, he was about to reply. It was Thomas Addas Emmet, the son of the
    state physician of Ireland&mdash;then a young lawyer of great promise, and
    now the Attorney-General of New York. The handsome and animated Dr.
    Mackenna, one of the most popular writers of the day, and Oliver Bond,
    the representative of the most reputable class of merchants, had grouped
    forward their intelligent heads; while one who brought no personal
    beauty to the cause (that letter of recommendation to all causes), James
    Napper Tandy, stood waiting with a packet of letters, which he had
    received in his former quality of secretary to the meeting.
</p>
<p>
    While other leaders of the Union distinguished for their birth, talents,
    or principles (and it is remarkable that they were all protestants),
    filled up the seats near the head of the table; more mixed groups less
    distinguished by the <i>beau sang</i>, which then came forth, in the fine
    forms of the genuine Irish gentry of both sects, were congregated in the
    obscurity of the bottom of the room&mdash;<i>Lady Morgan's O'Briens and
    O'Flahertys.</i>

    STORY OF RICHARD PLANTAGENET, SON OF RICHARD III.
</h3>
<p>
    It was on this awful night (the night preceding the battle of Bosworth
    Field), according to a letter which I have read from Dr. Thomas Brett to
    Dr. William Warren, president of Trinity-hall, that the king took his
    last farewell in his tent of Richard Plantagenet, his natural son, who
    himself thus describes that interview:&mdash;"I was boarded with a Latin
    schoolmaster, without knowing who my parents were, till I was fifteen or
    sixteen years old; only a gentleman, who acquainted me he was no
    relative of mine, came once a quarter and paid for my board, and took
    care to see that I wanted for nothing. One day this gentleman took me
    and carried me to a great fine house, where I passed through several
    stately rooms, in one of which he left me, bidding me stay there. Then a
    man richly dressed, with a star and garter, came to me, asked me some
    questions, talked kindly to me, and gave me some money. Then the
    fore-mentioned gentleman returned, and conducted me back to my school.
</p>
<p>
    "Some time after, the same gentleman came to me again with a horse and
    proper accoutrements, and told me I must take a journey with him into
    the country. We went into Leicestershire, and came to Bosworth Field,
    and I was carried to king Richard's tent. The king embraced me, and told
    me I was his son. 'But, child,' said he, 'to-morrow I must fight for my
    crown. And assure yourself if I lose that, I will lose my life too; but
    I hope to preserve both. Do you stand on yonder hill, where you may see
    the battle out of danger, and when I have gained the victory, come to
    me; I will then own you to be mine, and take care of you. But if I
    should be so unfortunate as to lose the battle, then shift as well as
    you can, and take care to let no one know that I am your father; for no
    mercy will be shown to any one so nearly related to me.' The king then
    presented me with a purse of gold, and giving me a farewell embrace,
    dismissed me from his tent. I followed the king's directions; and when I
    saw the battle lost and the king killed, I hastened back to London, sold
    my horse and fine clothes, and the better to conceal myself from all
    suspicion of being son to a king, and that I might have the means to
    live by my honest labour, I put myself apprentice to a bricklayer. But
    having a competent skill in the Latin tongue, I was unwilling to lose
    it; and having an inclination also to reading, and no delight in the
    conversation of those I am obliged to work with, I generally spend all
    the time I have to spare in reading by myself."
</p>
<p>
    The letter says, "When Sir Thomas Moyle built Eastwell House, near
    London, about the year, 1544, he observed his chief bricklayer, whenever
    he left off work, retired with a book. Sir Thomas had curiosity to know
    what book the man read, but was some time before he could discover it;
    he still putting the book up if any one came toward him. However, at
    last Sir Thomas surprised him, and snatched the book from him, and
    looking into it found it to be Latin. He then examined him, and finding
    he pretty well understood that language, he inquired how he came by his
    learning. Hereupon the man told him, as he had beer, a good master to
    him, he would venture to trust him with a secret he had never before
    revealed to any one. He then related the above story. Sir Thomas said,
    'You are now old, and almost past your labour; I will give you the
    running of my kitchen as long as you live.' He answered, 'Sir, you have
    a numerous family; I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>[pg
439]</span>
    have been used to live retired, give me leave to
    build a house of one room for myself in such a field, and there, with
    your good leave, I will live and die.' Sir Thomas granted his request,
    he built his house, and there continued to his death. Richard
    Plantagenet was buried the 22nd day of December, anno ut supra ex
    registro de Eastwell sub 1550. This is all the register mentions of him,
    so that we cannot say whether he was buried in the church or
    church-yard; nor is there now any other memorial of him except the
    tradition in the family, and some little marks where his house stood.
    This story my late Lord Heneage, earl of Winchelsea, told me in the year
    1720." Thus lived and died, in low and poor obscurity, the only
    remaining son of Richard III!

    FINE ARTS.
</h2>
<hr />
<h3>
    ART OF MOSAIC.
</h3>
<p>
    At Rome are many minor fine arts practised, which are wholly unknown in
    England. The most remarkable of them is the <i>Mosaic Manufactory</i>,
    carried on at the cost of government: and its fruits are theirs. The
    workmen are constantly occupied in copying paintings for altarpieces,
    though the works of the first masters are fast mouldering away on the
    walls of forgotten churches. They will soon be lost forever; it is yet
    possible to render them imperishable by means of Mosaic copies; and why
    is it not done? The French, at Milan, set an example of this, by
    copying, in mosaic, the <i>Last Supper</i> of Leonardo da Vinci; but it was
    their plan to do much for Milan, and nothing for Rome; and the
    invaluable frescos of Michael Angelo, Raphael, Domenichino, and Guido,
    were left to perish.
</p>
<p>
    It takes about seven or eight years to finish a mosaic copy of a
    painting of the ordinary historical size, two men being constantly
    employed. It generally costs from eight to ten thousand crowns, but the
    time and expense are of course regulated by the intricacy of the subject
    and quantity of work. Raphael's <i>Transfiguration</i>, cost about 12,000
    crowns, and the labour of nine years, ten men constantly working at it.
    The late works, are, however, of very inferior execution.
</p>
<p>
    The slab upon which the mosaic is made, is generally of Travertine, (or
    Tiburtine) stones, connected together by iron cramps. Upon the surface
    of this a mastic or cementing paste, is gradually spread, as the
    progress of the work makes it wanted, which forms the adhesive ground,
    or bed, on which the mosaic is laid. This mastic is composed of fine
    lime from burnt marble, and finely powdered Travertine stone, mixed to
    the consistence of a paste, with strong linseed oil. Into this paste are
    stuck the <i>smalts</i>, of which the mosaic picture is formed. They are a
    mixed species of opaque vitrified glass, partaking of the mixed nature
    of stone and glass, and composed of a variety of minerals and materials,
    coloured for the most part, with different metallic oxydes. Of these no
    less than 1,700 different shades are in use; they are manufactured in
    Rome in the form of long, slender rods like wires, of different degrees
    of thickness, and are cut into pieces of the requisite sizes, from the
    smallest pin point to an inch. When the picture is completely finished,
    and the cement thoroughly dried, it is highly polished.
</p>
<p>
    Mosaic, though an ancient art, is not merely a revived, but an improved
    one; for the Romans only used coloured marbles, or natural stones in its
    composition, which admitted of comparatively little variety; but the
    invention of smalts has given it a far wider range, and made the
    imitation of painting far closer. The mosaic work at Florence is totally
    different to this, being merely inlaying in <i>pietre dure</i>, or natural
    precious stones, of every variety, which forms beautiful, and very
    costly imitations of shells, flowers, figures, &amp;c. but bears no
    similitude to painting.
</p>
<p>
    Besides this government establishment at Rome, there are hundreds of
    artists, or artisans, who carry on the manufactory of mosaics on a small
    scale. Snuff-boxes, rings, necklaces, brooches, earrings, &amp;c. are made
    in immense quantity; and since the English flocked in such numbers to
    Rome, all the streets leading to the Piazza di Spagna are lined with the
    shops of these <i>Musaicisti</i>, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    Oriental shells are made at Rome into beautiful cameos, by the white
    outer surface being cut away upon the deeper coloured internal part,
    forming figures in minute bassi relievi. The subjects are chiefly taken
    from ancient gems, and sometimes from sculpture and painting. The shells
    used for this purpose are chiefly brought from the Levant; and these
    shell cameos make remarkably beautiful ornaments. Hundreds of artists
    also find support at Rome, in making casts, sulphurs, &amp;c. from ancient
    gems and medals, and in selling or fabricating antiques. Marble and
    stone-cutting are also beautifully executed both at Rome and
    Florence&mdash;<i>Abridged, (but interspersed) from "Rome in the 19th

<h3>
    LADY ARCHER,
</h3>
<p>
    Formerly Miss West, lived to a good age&mdash;a proof that
    cosmetics are not so fatal as has been supposed. Nature had given her a
    fine aquiline nose, like, the princesses of the house of Austria, and
    she did not fail to give herself a complexion. She resembled a fine old
    wainscotted painting with the face and features shining through a thick
    incrustation of copal varnish.
</p>
<p>
    Her ladyship was for many years the wonder of the fashionable world,
    envied by all the ladies that frequented the court. She had a splendid
    house in Portland-place, with <i>et caetera</i> equal in brilliancy and
    beauty to, or rather surpassing those of any of her contemporaries.
    Magnificent appendages were a sort of scenery. She gloried in milk-white
    horses to her carriage&mdash;the coachman and footman in grand shewy
    liveries&mdash;the carriage lined with a silk calculated to exhibit the
    complexion, &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
    I recollect, however, to have seen the late Mrs. Robinson go far beyond
    all this in the rich exuberance of her genius; a yellow lining to her
    landau, with a black footman, to contrast with her beautiful countenance
    and fascinating figure, and thus render both more lovely. Lady Archer's
    house at Barnes Elms Terrace, had an elegance of ornaments and drapery
    to strike the senses, and yet powerfully addressed to the imagination.
    She could give an insinuating interest to the scenes about her; which
    other eyes were viewing. Her kitchen garden and pleasure ground of five
    acres&mdash;the Thames running in front as if appertaining to the
    grounds&mdash;the apartments most tastefully decorated in the Chinese
    style&mdash;a fine conservatory opening, into the principal apartment with
    grapes, slow peaches, &amp;c. at the end a magnificent sofa, with a superb
    curtain all displayed with a peculiar grace and to the greatest
    advantage. Much praise was due to her arrangement of green and hot-house
    plants, the appellations of which she was well acquainted with, as also
    everything relating to their history.&mdash;<i>from the Papers of the late
    Alexander Stephens, Esq.</i>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
